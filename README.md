# Qt Graph Visualizer

This project is a simple interactive **graph editor** built with **Qt (C++/QtWidgets)**. It allows users to add, remove, move, and connect nodes visually, and provides support for import/export of the graph structure using JSON files.

## ✨ Features

- Add / remove nodes
- Drag and move nodes
- Connect nodes with edges
- Edge arrows for direction
- Customizable node and edge colors
- Configurable node radius
- Import/Export graph to JSON

## 📋 Todo

- [x] Add/Remove Nodes and Edges
- [x] Visual edge arrow direction
- [x] Import/Export JSON support
- [x] Add edge weights
- [x] Add labels to nodes and edges
- [ ] Highlight selected edges
- [x] Save and load node colors/radius
- [x] Implement pathfinding algorithms:
  - [x] Dijkstra's Algorithm (shortest path)
  - [x] A* Search Algorithm
- [ ] Implement Minimum Spanning Tree (MST):
  - [ ] Prim's Algorithm
  - [ ] Kruskal's Algorithm
- [ ] Visual animation for algorithm steps
- [ ] Undo/Redo support
- [ ] Search node by ID or label
- [ ] Save as image (SVG, PNG)
